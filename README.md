# SkyKnight-Quadcopter
We have implemented a quad-copter capable of self-sustained flight. Our quad-copter has 4 arms with propeller and motors on each. The propellers generate thrust that lifts the quad-copter against the gravity. ESCs (Electronic Speed Control ) are used to control the motor rotation speed depending on the PWM provided by SJOne board. We have implemented the self-stabilizing technique using PID algorithm. Android Application is also developed to provide user interface to control the motion of our quad-copter. The communication between android application and SJOne board is done using Bluetooth.
